<h2><u>Golf</u></h2>

<p>I have played Golf since I was 8 years old and was a member of Torquay Golf Club before I went to University. 
I struggled to find the time to play when my wife and I settled down and had our family, but I'm playing more now that my children are older.</p>

<h2><u>Bass Guitar</u></h2>

<p>I have started learning the Bass Guitar to compliment my brother's electric guitar playing. I enjoy listening to
and playing Rock and Metal music and hope to improve so we can play together at some stage.</p>

<h2><u>Video Games</u></h2>

<p>I have been playing video games since I was 3, when my Grandad bought me the Sega Mega Drive. It's a way to escape and 
unwind after a long day and is something that I still get a lot of enjoyment from.</p>
